# E-Commerce Site Demo

This project is currently in development (10/15/2023). Working on fixing bug with shopping cart not displaying total cost correctly. 

## Update 10/23/23:
This bug was tough to find, but it's finally fixed. My getTotalCartAmount() function was rendering the total inside of its loop iterating over the cart items. Super simple - moving the return out of the loop - fixed it.
